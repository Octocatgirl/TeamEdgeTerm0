GREAT JOB PLAYER! Or should I say Jordan. You have correctly given me your name, now I shall 
tell you the truth about the past. 

//5 years ago//

You and Catrina loved each other very much. Together you planned to live a happy life together
with her, but that was not to be the case. Catrina's father was against your relationship
with Catrina. So he forced Catrina into a arranged marriage. Catrina was then married to
Dave. Even Catrina was married to someone else you persisted. As long as your together
you will be happy you thought. Catrina higher you as maid, so you can be with her with
out Dave noticing. Catrina thought that Dave wasn't a bad person, but she turned out
to be wrong...

//4 years ago//

You start to notice an air on unease around Catrina. Confronting her she confessed
that she is carrying Dave's child. She told you how she did want to have a child,
but end up doing it to please Dave. This made feel concern about Catrina's 
realtionship with Dave.

//3 years ago//

Catrina end up conciving twins. One boy and one girl. As time went on it seem like Dave was
getting more and more controlling. 

//2 years ago//

Dave fired you and is trying to isolate Catrina. You need to do something about this.
Becuase Catrina's husband took away her phone, you and Catrina comunicate through letters.

//1 year ago//

Dave has gone crazy. The twins were found murdered. Dave and Catrina are missing. 

//1 week ago//

You have finnally found Catrina. You plan to break her out of the flat that Dave is 
keeping her in. You ened up failing. Catrina was unfortunaly crushed by the chandelier,
you killed dave in the bed room and then killed yourself becuase Catrina was dead. 

//Now//

~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

July/15/xxxx

Me and Dave had gotten married today. I'm suppose to be happy, but I'm not. I
wish Jordan was here. I suppose I can deal with Dave. He doesn't seem so bad.
He a lovely necklace that looked like it cost a fortune. 

September/29/xxxx

I am pregnant with my first child. I didn't want to carry a child from Dave,
but Dave insisted we have a child. He told me how can we be married and not
have a child. I am thinking of names for the baby. Dave want to name 'him'
Henry, but I think it will be a girl.

You notice that there is somthing under the mess of crystals and metal of what
used to be chandelier. You gasp there you find the mangled body of a women. She

You feel the peeling cover of the small book in your hands. It looks new, but
not well taken care of causing it to look old and worn. Opening it, in harshly
written letters it says:

I am done with all this. Catrina seems to be ignoring me. She's my wife she's
suppose to love me. I had to take away her phone to make sure that she wasn't 
seeing anyone else. She always seems depressed. Is it becuase I made her have 
kids? If she doesn't want the kids I'll take care of them. They were taking 
up space anyways. But why does she seem so happy when the maid comes...

_______________________________________________________________________________
You plug the charger into the wall. Then you plug the other end into your 
phone. After a few seconds the phone's screen bursts to life. The bright light
temporarly blinds you. After your eyes adjust you look at the screen. The time
is 3:33 am. Opening the phone you open the pictures. Scrolling through you see
many pictures of a women with short hair and and women with long brown hair.
They seemed very happy and close in the pictures. You open the text messages 
next. There is a chat between the phone user and someone named Catrina. The 
most recent messages say:

Catrina: I'm afriad we won't be able to text each other anymore :-:  

                                               Why?! Is it him! >:(  <<
                                              I swear I'll kill him! <<

Catrina: Yes it is him. He's taking away my phone. I won't be able to 
         text with out him noticing.

           Don't worry I find some other way to communicate with you <<
                                           I love you! Stay safe :-: <<

Catrina: I love you too Jordan <3  

Finding that there is nothing else significant on the phone. You turn it off

The charger is long and black. You see an outlet in the wall that you can 
plug it into. The end of the charger seems to be the perfect fit for a phone.
